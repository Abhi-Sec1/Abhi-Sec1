I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for monitoring, detecting, and responding to threats in enterprise environments. I am seeking a position as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Tier 1 Analyst, where I can leverage my skills in security monitoring, incident response, and automation.

## Objective

My goal is to help organizations identify and mitigate security threats by implementing proactive security measures, leveraging SIEM tools, and automating incident responses. With a strong foundation in security monitoring and threat detection, I am excited to contribute to a dynamic SOC team.
